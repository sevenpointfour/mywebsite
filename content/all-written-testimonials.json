He suggested some changes in my diet&mdash;like having sprouts instead of roti and vegetables for lunch, drinking chicory coffee instead of regular coffee at the office, and taking protein powder, among other things. However, I neither took it seriously nor enrolled in his offline course.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">In 2019, when I was diagnosed with diabetes, I had a wake-up call. The same day I received my reports, at around 2:30 PM, I rushed to his home in Kandivali. I showed him my reports and asked, \"What should I eat now?\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Until then, I had no idea about the scope of his work, how he operates, or how vast his contributions were. But I was certain that if I wanted to regain my health, dietary changes were the key. That&rsquo;s why I went to him instead of a doctor. I gradually started implementing his dietary recommendations, and whenever I faced difficulties, he helped me overcome them&mdash;whether it was about \"I can&rsquo;t do it\" or how to fit it into my financial budget.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">I still remember him saying, &ldquo;Pick up all the sugar in your house and throw it in the gutter.&rdquo; I used to think, \"I have 15 kg of sugar at home; let me finish it first, then I won&rsquo;t buy more.\" But he made me understand the damage that consumed sugar would cause to my health.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">As I started changing my diet, I began seeing results. The swelling in my feet reduced, I lost 15 kg, the sensation of constant burping disappeared, and, most importantly, my diabetes improved&mdash;my HbA1c dropped from 7.5 to 5.7 within a year and a half. That was a huge achievement for me! The doubts I had about whether I could do it vanished, and I felt incredibly happy. I realized that if I could do it, anyone could.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Initially, I thought I would have to eat a very limited variety of foods. But that wasn&rsquo;t the case. He had included links to 1,500 recipes in our food plan files. With some creativity, I could make different dishes using the ingredients he recommended, satisfying both my health needs and my taste buds.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">One more thing about me&mdash;I love mangoes! And diabetics are usually advised not to eat mangoes. I told him, \"I love mangoes; I won&rsquo;t give them up. Tell me anything else, and I&rsquo;ll follow it.\" He adjusted my food plan and meal timings accordingly. And guess what? I reversed my diabetes while still eating mangoes!</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; text-align: justify; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_85h41wgpabv1\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">Dada &ndash; A Trainer</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">As I started improving, my relatives, friends, and neighbors began asking, \"What are you doing? Tell us too!\" Slowly, as I started guiding them, Madhav Dada began training me on how to explain things to people&mdash;what to say, how to communicate, and how to let go afterward. He emphasized that our work is not about marketing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">This helped me understand how to take this training forward, and I started working with him as a <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Health Executive</strong>&mdash;and even started earning from it. I began enjoying my work as a Health Executive. My clients started seeing results, which increased my enthusiasm and faith in the work.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Then, the <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">nutrition training</strong> began. He told me, \"If you want to talk to clients, you need to study nutrition.\" I resisted, saying, \"I&rsquo;m a commerce student; I have no background in science.\" I kept making excuses to avoid studying. But he had solutions for every problem. He taught me how to study&mdash;\"If this doesn&rsquo;t work, try that; if that doesn&rsquo;t work, try something else.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">After four years, I finally developed an interest in studying. I still struggle to remember complex terms, but he insists that understanding the subject is more important.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Thus, the training format evolved. Initially, reading the course material felt overwhelming because of the scientific terms. So, he suggested watching videos and taking notes on key points.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Later, he divided the <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">nutrition course into three levels</strong>: Elementary, Executive, and Nutrition, each serving a different purpose. We had to clear each level step by step&mdash;passing the Elementary exam first, then the Executive exam, and finally, the Nutrition exam. Since learning 40 topics at once seemed impossible, he made it flexible&mdash;allowing us to take exams only on the topics we were ready for.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">The <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">exam format</strong> also evolved. In January 2025, we took exams on three nutrition topics, questioning each other during the process. This made us realize the depth of understanding needed. Some participants were even told, \"If you haven&rsquo;t personally experienced health transformation, you cannot proceed to the next exam.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">This course isn&rsquo;t just about <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">nutrition knowledge</strong>; it requires a solid foundation of <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">personal experience</strong>. Knowledge must be <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">converted into experience</strong>, which makes this training truly unique&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t seen anything like it anywhere else.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; text-align: justify; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_91g1y3osej91\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Dada &ndash; A Man of Absolute Frankness</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Dada was an extremely straightforward person (perhaps even excessively so), which made me feel intimidated when talking to him initially. But over time, I realized that whatever he said was for my own good. And it was precisely because he spoke so strongly that I started taking action.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">When clients used to ask, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"I want to become thin; can I get a food plan?\"</em>, Dada's response was always, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"I don't give diet/food plans for weight loss.\"</em> Hearing this used to shock me. I would think, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">If he refuses, we might lose a client!</em> But he was firm in his beliefs. He never compromised on his principles just to please people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Sometimes, clients would ask, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"I have a particular disease, I have high BP&mdash;will your food planning cure me?\"</em> His answer would simply be, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"I don&rsquo;t know.\"</em> He would bluntly tell clients, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"I don&rsquo;t give any guarantees.\"</em> As a result, some clients would get upset and decide not to take the food plan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Dada&rsquo;s words often felt harsh, and clients would get angry, wondering, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">How can he talk like this?</em> This would put me in an awkward position. That was until I understood the deeper truth behind his approach. Later, I started telling clients: <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"Just do what Dada says&mdash;don&rsquo;t focus on how he says it. Even if his words seem harsh, they are ultimately for your benefit.\"</em></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_ks9x7ypvsnv2\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">Personalized Food Planning</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">I began to understand the uniqueness of his approach. Some clients were Jain, some were vegan, some vegetarian, and others non-vegetarian. Yet, he accommodated all of them in his food plans. Some were advised to eat twice a day, while others were told to eat five times a day.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Dada always said, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"Bring me the person, let me see their blood reports, and then I&rsquo;ll decide how often they should eat.\"</em> He never gave a generic recommendation like <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"Everyone should eat twice or six times a day.\"</em> That is what true <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">personalized food planning</strong> means&mdash;what works for one person doesn&rsquo;t necessarily work for another. Every individual&rsquo;s body, parameters, and needs are different. <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">A one-size-fits-all approach just doesn&rsquo;t work!</em></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_biha5hhnlm87\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">Dada&rsquo;s Q&amp;A Sessions</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">The questions clients asked and the answers Madhav Dada gave could be a whole subject of study in itself. Even if two clients asked the exact same question, his responses would differ.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">When I asked him why, he said, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"I answer in a way that the person will understand or accept.\"</em> Sometimes he gave a straightforward answer, sometimes he asked counter-questions, sometimes he teased them playfully, and sometimes he even scolded them. But no matter which path he took, his ultimate goal was always the same&mdash;to ensure their well-being.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_9ma3vkox0peb\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">Dada &ndash; A Man of Principles</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Dada is a true food enthusiast. He has personally experimented with and created many dishes. He even helps clients fix their sweets if they don&rsquo;t turn out well. He taught me how to cook without oil according to the 7.4 principle. He loves trying different foods, and he particularly enjoys the meal served on the 13th day of mourning. So when my father-in-law passed away, he openly said, <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come for the 13th-day meal,&rdquo;</strong> without hesitation&mdash;of course, only if the meal was prepared according to the 7.4 principles. I honored his request, and the meal turned out excellent. This experience made me realize just how universally applicable the 7.4 principle is&mdash;it can be followed from a baby&rsquo;s naming ceremony to funeral rituals. This is particularly valuable for householders and families.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_plhrpy1y9853\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">Dada&rsquo;s Personal Transformation</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">I have personally witnessed the changes he has undergone over time. In the early days, he was very rigid in his views, firmly believing <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;I am right&rdquo;</strong> and refusing to consider other perspectives. He wouldn&rsquo;t even listen to opposing opinions, let alone accept them. For example, if a client said, <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give up tea, but I still want a food plan,&rdquo;</strong> he would simply refuse to provide one. However, as he evolved, his approach softened. Instead of outright rejection, he started advising, <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;If you have tea twice a day, reduce it to once. If you drink one cup, cut it down to half, and gradually quit.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">His vision for the <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Arogyaanubhuti Foundation</em> is <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;From Cellular Regeneration to Universal Brotherhood.&rdquo;</strong> He believes that once your cells start regenerating, your behavior and mindset will automatically change. Your body will produce <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">happy hormones</em>, and you won&rsquo;t need separate counseling or motivational sessions to achieve inner harmony. <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">(This is his exact phrase.)</em></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_vjf98tbabuts\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">Words of Experience</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Everything he teaches comes from firsthand experience&mdash;he never speaks without having tested it himself. This is why he speaks with such confidence, and his words truly resonate with people. He never discusses a topic unless he has deeply studied it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Once, a client asked him, <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;What happens if we eat stale food?&rdquo;</strong> Instead of answering immediately, he conducted a self-experiment&mdash;he ate stale food for <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">one and a half years</strong> while tracking his health parameters. Only after thorough observation did he confidently state, <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;It makes no difference&mdash;you can eat stale food without any harm.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_9qm92p4ov618\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">Dhanvantari Yoga</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Dada learned yoga from various institutions, but he wasn&rsquo;t fully satisfied. So, he experimented on himself and developed his own method, which he named <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;Dhanvantari Yoga.&rdquo;</strong> He taught it to us, ensured we practiced it, and even trained us to teach it to others. This yoga requires only <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">fifteen minutes a day</strong>, yet it effectively <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">services the entire body, tones muscles, strengthens joints, and most importantly, facilitates lymphatic movement.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_s2xqb9s3yrya\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">Beyond 7.4</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">This led to the creation of the <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Beyond 7.4 Course</strong>, which he designed and had us experience firsthand. The core principle of this course is <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;Observation.&rdquo;</strong> Each naturopathy process was to be done <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">one at a time</strong> while remaining in a state of observation.

My brother and Vinay Dada once attended a three-day <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Aarogya Shibir</em> conducted by Madhav Dada in Bhandup, but apart from that, I was unaware of his profound contributions to the field of nutrition.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">It was in 2019 that I happened to hear an online introductory talk by Madhav Dada, arranged by my brother, on the auspicious day of Ganesh Chaturthi. That session deeply resonated with me, and I immediately enrolled in his program. By October 2019, I had completed all the necessary procedures and started following his diet plan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">At that time, my weight was 70 kg, my HbA1c was 7, and my BP was 140/85.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">For seven years, I had tried various ways to reduce my weight, but nothing worked. However, just by following Madhav Dada&rsquo;s food plan, I lost 10 kg in 7-8 months&mdash;without any special effort. My weight naturally decreased by 1 to 1.5 kg per month as a byproduct of the plan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">I began feeling lighter, my HbA1c dropped to 5.7, and my BP returned to normal.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">I also learned <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">DY</em> from Dada and started practicing it daily. This gave a new direction to my life. I became so passionate about <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">YOG</em> that if I missed it for 2-3 days, I would dream about doing it! That&rsquo;s when I told myself, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"Why do it in my dreams when I can do it in real life?\"</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">With this combination of a proper food plan and <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">DY</em>, I found the perfect path to health. It felt like something I had been searching for all my life. <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">DY</em> required just 20 minutes a day and was completely hands-free.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">As my transformation became visible, people started complimenting me. My old clothes, which I couldn't wear before, started fitting again. My skin and physique improved, along with my blood parameters. Even today, people often guess my age to be 5-10 years younger than I actually am&mdash;no exaggeration!</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Inspired by my transformation, I became a <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">DY</em> teacher. I even began studying biochemistry&mdash;despite my commerce background! Under Madhav Dada&rsquo;s guidance, I created an online study group, where we have been studying biochemistry daily for the past 2-3 years. I cleared the exams conducted by Madhav Dada on behalf of <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Aarogyanubhuti Foundation</em> and started working as a nutritionist under his guidance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">As people noticed my transformation, they started inquiring and enrolling in the program. It became a wonderful opportunity for me to not only train in nutrition but also grow as a person.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Of course, studying biochemistry was not easy. Sometimes, I found it overwhelming, and on top of that, Madhav Dada would change the syllabus structure! There were times when I felt like crying. But these challenges helped me overcome my limitations and become stronger. He always pushed me to go beyond rote learning and truly understand the subject.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Though we sometimes had differing opinions, my trust in Madhav Dada remained unshaken. <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Opinions may differ, but bonds remain strong&mdash;that&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</em> I believe this is possible due to happy hormones, deep trust, and a ketone-based body, which make our connection resilient.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; text-align: justify; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_68kdwlkl19ge\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">The Power of Observation</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">One of the most valuable lessons I learned from Madhav Dada was the practice of <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">observation</em>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Being in observation mode allowed me to reduce the impact of emotions on my mind.

Once, I called him and said, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"I am about to share something important about someone regarding our work. You might get annoyed.\"</em> He was driving at the time. Instead of reacting, he calmly pulled over and said, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\"Wait, let me put myself in observation mode before listening.\"</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">Hearing that, I felt amazing!

It has also helped me handle negative emotions like sadness and helplessness&mdash;not by suppressing them but by observing them. This allowed me to transform sadness into knowledge and take the right actions in difficult situations.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 14.0pt; text-align: justify; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; page-break-after: auto;\"><a name=\"_eraqrua2ex5s\"></a><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: black;\">A Transformational Experience &ndash; <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Detox Shibir</em></span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">I attended the <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Detox Shibir</em> at Manchar with Madhav Dada twice.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;\">During the first <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">shibir</em>, after 36 hours of water fasting, I felt extremely weak.
